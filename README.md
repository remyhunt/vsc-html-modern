# Visual Studio Code Modern HTML Boilerplate
 
A featureful html boilerplate updated 2021 web standards.

This extension was inspired by [this](https://github.com/h5bp/html5-boilerplate/blob/master/src/index.html) popular github repository for HTML5 boilerplate, and this [blog post](https://www.matuzo.at/blog/html-boilerplate/) by Manuel Manuel Matuzovic. The markup used are all common and good  practices for SEO and accesibility. The writer of this post elegantly published the markup with details and justification line-by-line. I highly recommend visiting that post.

## v2.0.* Release Notes 

-Added a simplified version of the boilerplate, for users who are looking for more minimal functionality.

-Added a webmanifest json boilerplate snippet.
